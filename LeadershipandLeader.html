<header><h3>LEADERSHIP AND LEADER</h3></header>
<div>The above words cannot be fully explained without mentioning the word group or team.</div>
<div>A group or team is coming together of more than one person.</div>
<div>Leadership is the capacity of someone to lead.</div>
<div>Leader is a person who influence a group of people towards the achievement of a goal. A leader by its meaning is one who goes first
 and lead by example so that others are motivated to follow him/her. The truth is that, this is just a basic requirement.</div>
<div>In fairness, a leader must have a deep-rooted commitment to the goal that he/she will strive to achieve it even if nobody follows him/her.</div>
<div>As said above, it is obvious that a leader is meant to take actions. In a brainstorming scenario, a good leader should give room for suggestions 
or contributions of the team members first before adding is own quota. If the leader finds the members suggestions worthwhile executing, he/she should agree with the execution. 
This will make team members realize that they also have impact towards the achievement of their goal provided that they succeeded in their pursuit, otherwise the
 leader should provide reason why their suggestions should be forgone.</div>
 
<div>The main gist here is for the leader to be a good listener, allow input from the team members. And for the rest of the team members, 
you should be inquisitive (ask your leader questions), do self-reading and research because someday, YOU will be appointed as a leader in your career path or elsewhere.</div>
